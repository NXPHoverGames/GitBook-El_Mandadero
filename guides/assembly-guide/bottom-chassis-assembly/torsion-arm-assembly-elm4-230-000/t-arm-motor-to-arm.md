## Procedure

1. First step is gathering the Welded Torsion Arm Assembly and the Torsion Box Assembly, which will include the axle already in place and the PE rubber shore poured and cured. Then, insert the end of the axle that has the circular plates into the Welded Torsion Arm as shown in the _Axle insertion and attachment_ chapter of the video.
2.  Use an m2.5 Allen wrench to fasten the inner and outer sets of screws in the Torsion Arm. \

3. After securing the Axle to the Torsion Arm. Please gather the Motor Controller Housing and assemble it to the axle as shown in the second chapter of the video.\


The BLDC Hub Motor isnt attached to the motor arms using two U bolt clamps. The Hub Motor has a axle shaft stub already which is mostly round but with a flat machined area. \
\
The U-Bbolts are designed normally to clamp on to a round rod or axle. For this ELM assembly, we will turn the U-Bolt brackets upside down in order to form a flat surface. This flat surface will then press against the flat surface that is cut into the BLDC motor shafts.&#x20;

There are electrical control wires for the motor phases and the hall effect sensors that need to be carefully managed during this assembly process.

### Assembly Notes

* &#x20;Assembling the U-Bolts with the clamps in the correct orientation, and \*very lightly\* screwing them in place first seems to the the best procedure.&#x20;
* The wires are then fed into place.&#x20;
* Work one U-Bolt at a time. The shaft is then pushed in through the first clamp. Some downward pressure will prevent the U-Bolt from jostling out of place.
  * You may need to loosen the nuts even more, or remove one entirely to let the fully round part of the axle end past the U-bolt.&#x20;
  * once past the fully round section, rotate the Axle so the flat part is aligned with the flat part of the clamp. You may tighent the nuts slightly at this point.
  * Push the axle in further and repeat with the second U-bolt
