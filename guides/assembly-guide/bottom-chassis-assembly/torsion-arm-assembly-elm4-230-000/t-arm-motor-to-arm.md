## Procedure

1. Gather the Welded Torsion Arm Assembly and the Torsion Box Assembly.
2. Insert the end of the axle that has the circular plates into the Welded Torsion Arm as shown in the _Axle insertion and attachment_ chapter of the video.
3.  Use an m2.5 Allen wrench to fasten the inner and outer sets of screws in the Torsion Arm. \

4.  Now, gather the Motor Controller Housing and assemble it to the axle as shown next.\

5.  Take the U-Bolts and the clamps and insert the first into the latter making sure that the flat portion of the clamps is facing the bolts, as shown below.\

6. Insert the U-Bolts into the Torsion Arm and set them in the mounting holes, but do not fasten them yet.
7.  Grab the BLDC Hub Motor and insert it into the torsion arm, making sure the wiring goes first and through the U-Bolts.\

8.  Route the wiring through the axle access hole as shown below.\

9.  Tighten the U-Bolts against the the shaft of the motor hub. Then take the 4 nuts and secure the assembly wheel in place.\

10. Pick up the front plastic cover and clip it into place. Then secure it using two M5 screws at the top and one M3 screw at the sides.\

11. At last, grab the back plastic cover, clip it into the assembly and secure it using 4 M3 screws.\

## Assembly notes

* Assembling the U-Bolts with the clamps in the correct orientation, and **very lightly** screwing them in place first seems to the best procedure.&#x20;
* Work one U-Bolt at a time. The shaft is then pushed in through the first clamp. Some downward pressure will prevent the U-Bolt from jostling out of place.
  * You may need to loosen the nuts even more or remove one entirely to let the fully round part of the axle end past the U-bolt.&#x20;
  * once past the fully round section, rotate the Axle so the flat part is aligned with the flat part of the clamp. You may tighten the nuts slightly at this point.
  * Push the axle in further and repeat with the second U-bolt.
