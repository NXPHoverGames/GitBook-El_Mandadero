# T-Arm Axle to chassis

The torsion arm assembly consists of an Axle and an Arm. While the Arm could be attached to the axle first, It is preferred assembly sequence to attach the axle to the chassis base first.



{% hint style="warning" %}
Note you will need to leave at least ONE Torsion arm assembly temporarily disconnected in order to get the 220-001 cross braces in place.&#x20;

This is needed, as the opening in the chassis is used to angle the cross braces into place.&#x20;
