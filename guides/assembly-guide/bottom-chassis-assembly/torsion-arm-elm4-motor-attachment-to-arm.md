# Torsion Arm - ELM4 Motor attachment to arm

The BLDC Hub Motor is attached to the motor arms using two U bolt clamps. The Hub Motor has a axle shaft stub already which is mostly round but with a flat machined area. \
\
The U-Bbolts are designed normally to clamp on to a round rod or axle. For this ELM assembly, we will turn the U-Bolt brackets upside down in order to form a flat surface. This flat surface will then press against the flat surface that is cut into the BLDC motor shafts.&#x20;

There are electrcal control wires for the motor phases and the hall effect sensors that need to be carefully managed during this assembly process.\
\
Notes:

* &#x20;Assembling the U-Bolts with the clamps in the correct orientation, and \*very lightly\* screwing them in place first seems to the the best procedure.&#x20;
* The wires are then fed into place.&#x20;
* Work one U-Bolt at a time. The shaft is then pushed in through the first clamp. Some downward pressure will prevent the U-Bolt from jostling out of place.
  * You may need to loosen the nuts even more, or remove one entirely to let the fully round part of the axle end past the U-bolt.&#x20;
  * once past the fully round section, rotate the Axle so the flat part is aligned with the flat part of the clamp. You may tighent the nuts slightly at this point.
  * Push the axle in further and repeat with the second U-bolt
