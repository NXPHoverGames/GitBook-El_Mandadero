2.  Angle the Suspension Arm at a 45Â°'ish angle and insert the exposed portion of the axle first, ensuring it sits right above the rubber trim as so:\

3.  Pivoting on the rubber trim, turn the suspension arm to a straight angle while pushing inwards.\

## Assembly notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE that you will need to leave at least ONE Torsion arm assembly temporarily disconnected in order to get the 220-001 cross braces in place. This is needed, as the opening in the chassis is used to angle the cross braces into place.&#x20;
