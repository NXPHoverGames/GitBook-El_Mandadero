## Procedure

1. Grab the polycarbonate windows and fix them in place using the six M3-0.5x12 screws, washers and locknuts included in the kit.
2. Pivoting on the rubber trim, turn the suspension arm to a straight angle while pushing inwards.\

3. Once the suspension arm is in place, fix it using the included six M5-0.8x10 screws and their respective locknuts just as shown in the video.\

4.  Repeat the above steps with the remaining suspension arms.



## Assembly notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE that you will need to leave at least ONE Torsion arm assembly temporarily disconnected in order to get the 220-001 cross braces in place. This is needed, as the opening in the chassis is used to angle the cross braces into place.&#x20;
