## Assembly notes

{% hint style="info" %}
* You can use both of the screens with their peripherals facing either up or down. For the RC050 screen the plastic adapter includes a double set of holes to center the screen to either orientation.
* After installing the screens, steps 6 and 8 can come in either way, whether you install the side covers first or the top cover. Just make sure the side covers have the LED lights installed before putting the top cover in place.
* There is a side cover model for each screen variation.
